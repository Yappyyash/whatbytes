In this project, I developed a comprehensive user authentication system using Django. I created features for user registration, login, and password management. The registration process allows new users to sign up and be automatically logged in, while the login feature lets existing users access their accounts.

I implemented a user dashboard to display personalized information, and a profile page where users can view their details, such as username, email, and account activity. From the profile page, users can also navigate to the change password page.

For the change password functionality, I built a secure form where users can update their passwords, requiring their old password and confirming the new one. After successfully changing the password, users are redirected to their dashboard.

Additionally, I integrated a "Forgot Password" feature, which allows users to reset their passwords via email. This includes sending reset instructions and managing the entire password reset process.

Overall, this project utilizes Django's powerful features to build a secure and user-friendly authentication system with essential functionalities like registration, login, profile management, and password recovery.
